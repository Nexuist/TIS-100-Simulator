### Introduction

The game [`TIS-100` by Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) features a simple assembly language that is run by each "node" in the game. This software project is an attempt to recreate the interpreter for that language so that it can be used outside of the game.

### Usage

1. Write your assembly program using the TIS-100 Reference Manual (a copy is available [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=456879799)).

2. Save it as an .asm file. An example is included in this project: [test.asm](/test.asm)

3. `python asm.py [asm]`
	* For example: `python asm.py test.asm`

4. More to come!

### WIP

This is a work in progress and has not been finished yet.
